big deal  but for my six year old the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly\\n\\nhe brushes with enthusiasm now and ive noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a

big deal  but for my six year old the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly\\n\\nhe brushes with enthusiasm now and ive noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a
